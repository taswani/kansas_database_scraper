Flint Hills Volunteer Center
2601 Anderson Ste 200
Manhattan, KS  66502
(785) 776-7787
The Flint Hills Volunteer Center is driven by its mission of connecting volunteers to the needs of our community. As our community grows rapidly, the issues we face continue to increase in providing resources for unmet basic human needs. We currently have a database of 1,060 volunteers, 60 nonprofit agencies, and over 125 volunteer opportunities. Core programs include Schools of Hope, Youth Volunteer Corps, Suicide Prevention, Frauds and Scams, Opioid Epidemic, and Neighbors Helping Neighbors and more.
Our Core Programs are:
â¢	RSVP (Retired Senior Volunteer Program). RSVP is one of the largest volunteer networks in the nation for people 55 and over. Volunteers use the skills and talents theyâve learned over the years, or they develop new ones while serving in a variety of volunteer activities within our community. 
â¢	Schools of Hope provides quality academic mentors that make an influential difference in a childâs life.  The programâs volunteers provide an invaluable resource of literacy intervention for K-3 students in USD 383. The ability to read is a powerful predictor of later academic achievement and success in life. Research shows that a student who is not at least moderately successful in reading by the end of third grade is unlikely to graduate high school. 
â¢	Youth Volunteer Corps utilizes team-based, service-learning volunteer opportunities for young people as a conduit to teach workplace readiness skills, enhance academic performance, inspire a lifetime commitment to service, and address the needs of recipient nonprofit organizations. Recruitment targets middle and high school students.
 2019 New Core Programs:
â¢	Suicide Prevention will utilize trained volunteers to educate the community on risk factors for suicide, along with the interventions available for help.
â¢	Opioid Epidemic will utilize trained volunteers to educate the community on drug addiction while providing resources for proper medication disposal.
â¢	Elder Justice will utilize trained volunteers to educate the community on elder abuse, neglect and financial fraud and scams that target our nationâs seniors.
â¢	Neighbors Helping Neighbors is a volunteer program in the city of Manhattan that helps elderly residents remain in their home. This program connects volunteers, volunteer groups, and organizations with Manhattan residents who need assistance. Volunteers help with snow removal and basic yard work.

The Greater Expectations program is unique in that it is inclusive rather than exclusive. Our targeted population are those individuals with high-functioning autism as well as other developmental disabilities who do not qualify for any support or services post high school. Most are academic achievers, however, they need support and assistance in four key areas: social skills, life skills, organizational skills, and communication/advocacy. The Greater Expectations program strives to provide a program that allows these individuals to acquire the skills and tools they need to get their job of choice in the community, attend college with greater success, and live independently if that is their choice. Participants are not employed at Autism Avenue. Autism Avenue is the last step of their program as they are offered the opportunity to practice and refine their skills before seeking employment in the community just as any other peer their age would aspire to do.

Parents as Teachers (PAT) is a parent education and family support program serving families throughout pregnancy until their child reaches the age of 5. Parents are supported by PAT-certified parent educators trained to translate scientific information on early brain development into specific when, what, how and why advice for families. By understanding what to expect during each stage of development, parents can easily capture the teachable moments in everyday life to enhance their child's language development, intellectual growth, social development and motor skills
As a PAT family, you receive:
Personal Visits - during which your parent educator will share age-appropriate child development and parenting information, help you learn to observe your child, and address your parenting concerns.
Parent group meetings -- which are opportunities to share information about parenting issues and child development. Parents learn and support each other, observe their children with other children and practice parenting skills.
Screenings -- to assess your child's overall development as well as health, hearing and vision. Resource network -- that links your family to other community services.

Juvenile Field Services places emphasis on public safety, preventing future offenses through the use of evidence-based correctional practices and services, education, employment and enhancing positive family impact on the offender's behavior.  Offenders are supervised on level systems based on their level of risk to reoffend as determined by evidence-based correctional risk assessments.  Contacts with employers, educators, treatment providers, caregivers and the offender are characteristic of these programs.  In some cases electronic monitoring is used to restrict freedom and provide sanctions for minor violations of the conditions of supervision.  If the offender violates the rules, staff is quickly notified and can take action.

JFS Programs:

Juvenile Intensive Supervision Program (JISP) is an intensive community based program providing services to offenders at risk of entering state's custody and placed on intensive supervision probation by the Court.

Juvenile Case Management (JCM) provides supervision and case management for youth in the custody of the KDOC-JS.  Some juveniles served by this program are placed outside their family homes in a variety of settings including:  detention, resource homes, residential treatment facilities, and independent living programs.

Conditional Release (CR) provides supervision and case management for youth returning to the community from juvenile correctional facilities on conditional release.  Juveniles served by this program are placed in their family homes, detention, resource homes, residential facilities, treatment programs, and independent living programs.

Judge Riddel Boys and Girls Alternative Program is delivery of evidence-based cognitive behavioral programming with fidelity at the appropriate intensity.  This type of programming has been proven to reduce recidivism in juveniles assessed to be at moderate to high risk on the state risk assessment instrument.

Evening Reporting Center is funded by the Kansas Department of Corrections-Juvenile Services Reinvestment and Regional Grants.  The Reinvestment Grant targets Sedgwick County youth scoring moderate to high risk as determined by risk assessment and who would have been candidates for out of home placement.  The services include evidence-based programming and incentives to youth.  The Regional Grant enables the development of collaboration with the following counties:  Butler, Elk, Greenwood, Cowley, Harvey, McPherson and Sumner to address service needs and gaps.  Services will be directed at addressing criminogenic needs, evidence-based programs based on responsibility factors and can be expanded to address other needs.
